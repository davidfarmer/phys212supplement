    <title>Repulsive and attractive tape</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Take some magic Scotch tape and tear off a piece about 6 inches long.
        Attach it to the edge of a desk or table so that it hangs down.
        Then get another piece and stick the new (top) piece to the non-sticky side of the first (bottom) piece.
        Then quickly pull them apart and hang both of them from edge of the table.
        Label the strip that had been initially on the top
        <q>T</q>
        and label the other one
        <q>B.</q>

            <p>
              Next hold them so that the ends can come near each other.
              Do they attract?
              Repel?
              Neither?
              Try to write down a brief explanation.

    <title>Repulsive balloons</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Blow up two balloons
        (not quite as full as possible)
        and tie them so they don't leak.
        Take a piece of string and attach
        (tie or tape)
        a balloon to each end,
        then hold the string in the middle and let the balloons at each end hang down.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Now charge up the balloons by rubbing them against a fuzzy sweater or whatever you're wearing.
              Be sure to turn the balloon so that all parts get charged.
              Holding the string in the middle
              (and keeping your body parts away from the balloons!),
              what do you observe about the way the balloons hang?
              Make a sketch.
              Then make a force diagram for one of the balloons,
              showing all of the forces acting on the balloon (tension,
              electric and gravitational) and their relative magnitudes.
              <em>Note:</em> Since the balloons are in equilibrium,
              your force vectors should add up to zero.
              Make sure that they are drawn to reflect this.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Now, carefully grab one balloon and push it slowly toward the other.
              Make sure that the balloons stay at the same height,
              so that a line through their centers remains roughly horizontal.
              What happens to the distance between the balloons as the string on the non-held balloon makes bigger and bigger angles with the vertical?
              When you have moved the held balloon enough so that the distance between the balloons is clearly different from that in part (a),
              make a force diagram for the non-held balloon,
              showing all the forces and their relative magnitudes. (The sizes of the arrows should also reflect any changes in the forces with respect to part (a).) <em>Comments:
              </em> Again, the balloon is in equilibrium,
              so the force vectors should add up to zero.
              But since your tension force is closer to horizontal now,
              what has to happen to its magnitude to keep the net force in the <m>y</m>-direction zero?
              What has to happen to the electric force to keep the net force in the <m>x</m>-direction zero?
              Make sure that your diagram is consistent with your observation about the distance between the balloons.

      <p>
        (Optional) BE CAREFUL with this one.
        A strong permanent magnet can magnetize parts of your monitor.
        This causes distortion of the images in both shape and color.
        Most monitors automatically can get rid of these extra fields using something called a
        <q>de-gausser</q>, but the de-gausser doesn't usually activate except when the monitor is turned on
        (and is cold),
        so it might not fix the damage for a while,
        assuming the de-gausser is working.
        Thus the caution.
        Most monitors receive no permanent damage,
        but you never know, so don't go wrecking someone else's stuff.

      <p>
        A very simple application of magnetic forces can be used to make a nifty device called a
        <q>rail gun.</q>
        These have been proposed as devices that could be used to send back to earth
        (or the moon)
        raw materials mined from an asteroid.
        The idea is shown in the figure below.
        A bar of mass <m>m</m> can slide on two parallel rails separated by a distance <m>H</m>,
        and the whole apparatus is in a uniform magnetic field with magnitude <m>B</m> pointing into the plane of the paper.
        The rails are hooked up to a current source,
        and a current <m>I</m> passes through the rails and through the bar,
        which experiences a force that accelerates it down a track of length <m>D</m>.
        A bucket can be put on the bar,
        and anything in the bucket gets thrown off when the bar reaches the end of the rail.
      </p>
      <p>
        Given the information above,
        determine the speed of the bar just before it reaches the end of the rails.

    <title>Soap films and bubbles</title>

            Here's one to try in the shower!
            Get your hands very wet and soapy.
            Then slowly slide your forefinger along your thumb stretching a soap film bigger and bigger.
            You can catch it on your other hand as demoed in lecture to make a big thin film.
            In fact, if your hands are wet,
            you can catch soap bubbles without popping them.
            (This is a great thing to do on a day just after it has rained <mdash/> blow a bunch of soap bubbles on the wet pavement.
            They won't pop.)
            If you are not good at this,
            try using bubbles from the soap bubble bottle in your kit.
            Blow a big bubble, catch it on the wand,
            and hold it while it thins out.
            Now with the light behind you,
            look at the reflections off the film.
            You should see some really cool patterns of colors!
            Try to sketch the patterns (later) and show where each color is.
            In a few sentences,
            try to explain what you see in terms of thin films that you studied in class.

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            (Optional if weather cooperates.) After it has rained,
            look at the pavement in the street or parking lots where cars are or have been.
            You might see a blotch of color.
            This usually indicates that a drop of oil has fallen on the ground. (A good place to look for these splotches is underneath cars driven by Bucknell faculty.) If you see one of these colorful oil spots,
            try stepping on it or brushing your foot over it.
            Comment on what you see and try to explain what you see in terms of the thin films that you studied in class.

    <title>Fiber optics toy</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Load up your fiber optics flashlight toy (Galaxy Wand) with the two little batteries
        (this may have already been done for you).
        Turn it on and notice how the cool colors of light come out the ends of the fibers but not out the sides.
        Take one of the fibers and bend it until it kinks.
        (If it breaks, try again.)
        Some of the light in that fiber will escape.
        Why does it escape?
        Why doesn't it escape if you make smooth curves in the fiber rather than a kink?

    <title>Implications of photoelectric effect</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Professor Quack doesn't believe in quantum theory.
        To make his point he does a photoelectric experiment.
        He takes a white light source and two filters <mdash/> one filter allows blue light to pass,
        and one filter allows green light to pass.
        He measures the current when the blue filter is in place and finds that it is <em>less</em>
        than the current he measures with the green filter in place.
        He argues that according to quantum theory blue photons should have more energy than green photons,
        so the blue light should result in a greater current than that caused by the green light.

    <title>Tunneling and time-energy uncertainty</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider an electron hitting a barrier.
        Assume the electron has an energy <m>E = 50\Xunits{eV}</m>,
        and the barrier has a height <m>U = 100\Xunits{eV}</m>.
        Semi-classically, to tunnel through the barrier, the electron must
        <q>borrow</q>
        enough energy to get over the barrier,
        and must hold this energy long enough to travel the width of the barrier.
        The best-case scenario is if the energy fluctuates up to a value of <m>2U - E</m> or <m>150\Xunits{eV}</m>.
        (See
        <q>Optional problem</q>
        below if you want to see where this comes from.)
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Using the energy-time uncertainty relation <m>\Delta E \Delta t \approx \hbar</m>,
              approximate the typical duration of the energy fluctuation (i.e., determine <m>\Delta t</m>).

            <p>
              Determine the classical velocity of the electron in the barrier region if it has an energy of <m>150\Xunits{eV}</m>.
              (Warning: the kinetic energy of the electron is not <m>150\Xunits{eV}</m> here.)

          <li>
            <p>
              The width <m>L</m> that you have just determined is a width for which you would expect a reasonable probability for an electron to tunnel through a barrier.
              You can calculate the transmission probability <m>T</m> explicitly by <m>T = e^{-2\alpha L}</m>,
              where <m>\alpha = \sqrt{2m(U-E)/\hbar^2}</m>.
              Use your value of <m>L</m> and the information given above to verify that you get a reasonable value for <m>T</m>. (by
              <q>reasonable,</q>
              we mean that you should get a probability greater than 0.1, but,

        (You don't have to hand this in.) For the preceding
        <q>A</q>
        problem, show that the semi-classical approach discussed for tunneling gives the largest value of the barrier width <m>L</m> if the particle borrows enough energy
        <m>\Delta E</m> to get to an energy of <m>(2U - E)</m>.
        Hint: Use the approach from the previous problem to find the maximum barrier width <m>L</m> if the particle fluctuates up to an energy of <m>E_{ high}</m>.
        Then take the derivative <m>dL/dE_{ high}</m> and set this equal to zero to figure out the optimal <m>E_{ high}</m>.
        Note: conceptually,
        the optimal energy is a small enough energy such that <m>\Delta t</m> is relatively long,
        but large enough such that the electron still has some kinetic energy while traveling across the barrier.

        Download the Excel worksheet <c>semi-finite.xls</c> from either the <em>Handouts</em>
        page or from the Calendar page.
        This sheet shows the calculations for determining the wavefunctions for a potential well that is infinite at <m>x=0</m> but of finite magnitude on the right side of the well
        (which is at <m>x=5</m> in this problem).
        You'll see two graphs: the top one shows the semi-infinite potential well
        (in purple)
        along with a non-normalized plot of the calculated wavefunction so you can see it along with the potential.
        The bottom graph shows the normalized wavefunction,
        corresponding to the second-to-last column in the worksheet.
      </p>

        the energy will be set for the value for the ground state.

              To display the 1<m>^{ st}</m> and <m>2^{ nd}</m> excited states,
              type in 0.64282 and 1.4144 respectively in the framed box for energy.

              Explain briefly how you calculated this from the Excel worksheet.
              <em>Hint:</em> Remember that for a continuous wavefunction <m>\psi(x)</m>,
              the probability of finding the particle in a particular region is <m>\int_{x_1}^{x_2} P(x)\, dx = \int |\psi (x)|^2\, dx</m>.
              However, we don't actually have a wave function to integrate;
              we have a numerical solution instead.
              But we can do a <em>Riemann Sum</em>
              and add up the contributions:
              <m>\sum_i P(x_i)\, \Delta x = \sum |\psi(x_i)|^2\, \Delta x</m>.
              You'll have to determine what

    <statement>
      <p>
        Find a friend to help you explore magnetic resonance.
        Take your magnet and tie string around it so it is supported in the center and hangs horizontally when you hold the string above and below the magnet.
        Have your friend bring his/her magnet nearby and note that your magnet tries to align.
        Keeping the string fairly tight,
        use your hand to twist the magnet slightly.
        Are you putting energy into the system?
        What happens when you release the magnet?
        On the atomic scale, where does this released energy go?

        Resonance is observed when the strength of the constant external magnetic field equals 0.78 T. Calculate the strength of the local magnetic field at the site of the protons that are undergoing spin flips,

    <statement>
      <p>
        The proton, like the electron,

        In the hydrogen atom in its ground state (<m>n = 1</m> and <m>l = 0</m>),
        there are two energy levels,
        depending on whether the electron and proton spins are parallel or anti-parallel.
        If the electron of an atom has a spin flip from the state of higher energy to that of lower energy,
        a photon of wavelength 21 cm is emitted.
        Radio astronomers observe this 21 cm radiation coming from deep space.

        The parking lot has a rectangular shape on an <m>x</m>-<m>y</m> coordinate system with dimensions <m>100\Xunits{m}\times 50\Xunits{m}</m>,
        and the lot is divided into three sections,
        <em>A</em>, <em>B</em>, and <em>C</em>
        (see figure).
        Although the lot is more conventional, John still tells car owners the whereabouts of their cars in terms of probabilities and probability densities,
        only now the probability densities are given in terms of
        <em>probability per unit area</em>
        instead of of <em>probability per unit length</em>,
        and they are functions of two variables, <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.

    <title>Time-dependence of wave functions for particle-in-box</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        In previous chapters we discussed wavefunctions for particles rather than the abstract state-vector representation we have been using for properties like
        <q>spin.</q>
        The time dependence of wavefunctions can be handled in the same way as the time dependence of spin states.
        First, we write the wavefunction as a normalized linear combination of wavefunctions for states with definite energies,
        and each piece of the sum gets a factor of <m>e^{-iE_it/\hbar}</m>.
        Consider a
        <q>particle in a box</q>
        that starts in a linear combination of the ground state and the first excited state.
        The initial wavefunction is
        <me>
          \psi(t=0) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{L}}\sin\left(\frac{\pi x}{L}\right)+ \sqrt{\frac{1}{L}}\sin\left(\frac{2\pi x}{L}\right)
        </me>,
        and at a later time the wave function is
        <me>
          \psi(t) = e^{-iE_1t/\hbar}\sqrt{\frac{1}{L}}\sin\left(\frac{\pi x}{L}\right)+ e^{-iE_2t/\hbar}\sqrt{\frac{1}{L}}\sin\left(\frac{2\pi x}{L}\right)
        </me>,
        where <m>E_1 = \frac{h^2}{8mL^2}</m> and
        <m>E_2 = \frac{h^2}{2mL^2}</m> are the energies of the two lowest states of a particle in a box.
        In your work for parts (a) and (b) you should leave the energies as <m>E_1</m> and <m>E_2</m>.

              How does it compare with the sound made when you whirl the tube?
              Check all three of the frequencies this way.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The sound made by the whirly tube may not perfectly matching the calculated frequencies.
              Some questions: (a) Is the lowest frequency note that you are hearing,
              in fact, the lowest possible mode?
              For some tubes, the lowest note that you hear is actually the
              <em>second</em> lowest mode.
              So, instead of hearing the lowest three (1, 2 and 3),
              you might be hearing modes 2, 3 and 4. (b) The antinodes don't occur exactly at the ends of the tube.
              Adjust the frequency of the online tone generator up or down until the match is better.
              What does this tell you?
              Are the anti-nodes separated by a distance greater 75<nbsp/>cm or less than 75<nbsp/>cm?
