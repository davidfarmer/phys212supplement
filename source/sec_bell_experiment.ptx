  <title>Bell's Proposed Experiment</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Bell changed all that.
      To everyone's great surprise,
      in 1964 he constructed a thought experiment where quantum mechanics and hidden variable theories actually predict different results.
      This thought experiment suddenly made it an experimental question,
      so nature could tell us who was right!
    </p>
    <p>
      Bell's clever idea rested on a variation of the EPR thought experiment where the Stern-Gerlach device that is measuring the positron spin is rotated.
      The electron's spin is still measured the same way,
      so we will find <m>S_z = +\hbar/2</m> or <m>-\hbar/2</m> as before.
      But the positron's spin is measured along some direction <m>\hat n</m> that makes an angle <m>\theta</m> with respect to the <m>z</m> axis,
      as shown in <xref ref="fig_bell_experiment">Figure</xref>.
      For simplicity, we will take <m>\theta = 45^\circ</m>.

    <title>QM Prediction for the Bell Experiment</title>
    <p>
      If we rotate our positron detector to be
      <m>45^\circ</m> from the <m>z</m>-axis and measure this component of the spin,
      call it <m>S_{45^\circ}</m>, what possible values will we find?
      Just like with any spin component,
      we'll find <m>+\hbar/2</m> and <m>-\hbar/2</m>.
      And after the measurement,
      the spin will be in either the
      <m>\ket{\nearrow}</m> state or the <m>\ket{\swarrow}</m> state,
      just as an <m>S_x</m> measurement results in either the
      <m>\ket{+x}</m> or <m>\ket{-x}</m> states.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can relate our familiar up and down spins to this new pair of states:
      <md>
        <mrow xml:id="eq_rotated_basis" number="yes">\ket{\uparrow} \amp =  b_+\ket{\nearrow} + b_-\ket{\swarrow} \amp \ket{\downarrow} \amp =  b_-\ket{\nearrow} - b_+\ket{\swarrow}</mrow>
      </md>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coefficients, <m>b_+</m> and <m>b_-</m> are given by
      <md>
        <mrow xml:id="eq_b_variables" number="yes">b_+ \amp = \sqrt{\frac{1+\cos \theta}{2}}  \amp b_- \amp = \sqrt{\frac{1-\cos \theta}{2}}</mrow>
      </md>,
      where <m>\theta</m> is measured from the <m>z</m>-axis as shown in <xref ref="fig_bell_experiment">Figure</xref>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We'll create an electron-positron pair in the initial state given by <xref ref="eq_epr_bell_state"/>.
      Let's explore what quantum mechanics predicts for the Bell Experiment.
      We're going to consider the case where an observer measures <m>S_z^\text{ elec }</m> to be spin down.
      According to quantum mechanics,
      a measurement of <m>S_z^\text{ elec }</m> =
      <m>-\hbar/2</m> collapses the state of our electron-positron pair to be <m>\ket{\psi} = \ket{\downarrow\uparrow}</m>.
      To put it another way,
      if we measure the state of the electron to be <m>\ket{\downarrow}</m>,
      quantum entanglement says that the state of the positron must be <m>\ket{\uparrow}</m>.
      The subsequent positron measurement will find
      <m>S_{45^\circ}</m> to be either <m>+\hbar/2</m> or
      <m>-\hbar/2</m> with probabilities that depend on the <m>b_+</m> and <m>b_-</m> variables.
      Since the positron state is <m>\ket{\uparrow}</m>,
      the probability of measuring <m>S_{45^\circ}^\text{ pos }</m> = <m>+\hbar/2</m> is
      <m>\left|b_+\right|^2</m> and the probability of measuring <m>S_{45^\circ}^\text{ pos }</m> =
      <m>-\hbar/2</m> is <m>\left|b_-\right|^2</m>.
      In your homework, you will calculate these probabilities.

    <title>Hidden Variable Prediction for the Bell Experiment</title>
    <p>
      Now here is where it gets interesting: Bell constructed a proof that <em>any</em>
      hidden variable theory<fn>
      Technically, any <em>local</em> hidden variable theory,
      to satisfy the lawyers and mathematicians.
      </fn> with the detectors oriented as in <xref ref="fig_bell_experiment">Figure</xref>
      and with <m>\theta=45^\circ</m> will result in probabilities that are incompatible with the predictions of quantum mechanics.
      So, either the hidden variable theory or quantum mechanics must be wrong!
    </p>
    <p>
      While we won't provide a proof of Bell's theorem in full generality here,
      we will show how to determine the predictions of hidden variable theory introduced in <xref ref="example_hidden_variable_theory">Example</xref>
      of <xref ref="sec_epr_paradox">Section</xref>.
      According to this hidden variable theory,
      the electron and positron have fully determined spin values <m>\vec S^\text{ elec } = -\vec S^\text{ pos }</m>,
      but we just don't know them.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig_hidden_variable_calculation">
      <caption>The circle represents all possible <m>\vec S^ pos</m>
      directions.  After a measurement of <m>S_z^ elec  =-\hbar/2</m>, the
      possible directions of <m>\vec S^ pos</m> are limited to the upper
      hemisphere (shaded region).</caption>
      <image width="26%" source="images/hidden_variable_calculation"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Picture the positron spin variable <m>\vec S^\text{ pos }</m>.
      Since we don't know its value and we aren't in any way controlling how it is set when the electron-positron pair are created,
      it is reasonable to assume it is equally likely to be pointing in any direction.
      We can represent all possible directions of
      <m>\vec S^\text{ pos }</m> by the surface of a sphere,
      where the vector <m>\vec S</m> has its tail on the origin.
      A circular cross section of this sphere is shown in <xref ref="fig_hidden_variable_calculation">Figure</xref>.
      The dashed line in the figure is the boundary between the positive and negative values for <m>S_{45^\circ}^\text{ pos }</m>.
      That is, for spins <m>\vec S^\text{ pos }</m> above and to the right of the dashed line a measurement would result in <m>S_{45^\circ}^\text{ pos }</m> = <m>+\hbar/2</m>.
      The region below and to the left corresponds to <m>S_{45^\circ}^\text{ pos }</m> = <m>-\hbar/2</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now consider the case where we have measured the electron's <m>z</m>-component of spin and found <m>S_z^\text{ elec }</m> = <m>-\hbar/2</m>.
      This happens half the time,
      and when it happens the positron
      <m>\vec S^\text{ pos }</m> must be somewhere in the upper hemisphere,
      shown as the shaded region in <xref ref="fig_hidden_variable_calculation">Figure</xref>.
      This agrees with the QM prediction so far,
      where if we measure <m>S_z^\text{ elec }</m> = <m>-\hbar/2</m>,
      we know that we would also measure <m>S_z^\text{ pos }</m> = <m>+\hbar/2</m>.
      But, here, rather than the positron actually
      <em>being in a spin up state</em>,
      the hidden variable theory says that the original
      <m>\vec S^\text{ pos }</m> should determine the probabilities for measuring <m>S_{45^\circ}^\text{ pos }</m> as spin up or down.
      According to the figure,
      a fraction 3/4 of the shaded region results in a value <m>S_{45^\circ}^\text{ pos }</m> = <m>+\hbar/2</m>.
      Bell constructed a proof that for
      <em>any</em> hidden variable theory,
      this fraction of 3/4 is the <em>maximum</em>
      probability of measuring <m>S_{45^\circ}^\text{ pos }</m> = <m>+\hbar/2</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, let's recap.
      We create an electron-positron pair in the state:
      <men>
        \ket{\psi} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{\uparrow\downarrow} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{\downarrow\uparrow}
      </men>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We make a measurement of the <m>z</m>-component of the electron's spin,
      and we find that the electron is spin down.
      Quantum mechanics says that the positron is thus in the state <m>\ket{\uparrow}</m>,
      which means the probability of measuring <m>S_{45^\circ}^\text{ pos }</m> =
      <m>+\hbar/2</m> is <m>\left|b_+\right|^2</m>,
      or 85%. The hidden variable theory says that the positron spin is determined by its original <m>\vec S^\text{ pos }</m>,
      and we have a <m>\le</m>75% probability of measuring <m>S_{45^\circ}^\text{ pos }</m> = <m>+\hbar/2</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <ellipsis/> so which is right?
