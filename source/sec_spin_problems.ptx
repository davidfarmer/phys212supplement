              How would we expect the spectrum of photons absorbed by this atom to change in the presence of a strong magnetic field versus in the absence of a magnetic field?
              How would this spectrum change as the strength of the magnetic field increases?

        Let's use a simulation of the Stern-Gerlach experiment to explore quantum states and spin.

      <p>
         <c>http://phet.colorado.edu/sims/stern-gerlach/stern-gerlach_en.html</c> By default,
        the atoms start in the state <m>\vert +x \rangle</m>,
        and the device is setup to make a measurement of the <m>z</m>-component of spin.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              To get a feel for how this works, try firing a few atoms.
              You'll notice a counter at the bottom of the page keeping track of how many atoms have been measured to be spin up or spin down as measured along the <m>z</m> axis.
              Can you predict whether an individual atom will have a measured <m>z</m>-component of spin up or down?

          <li>
            <p>
              For atoms starting in the state <m>\vert +x \rangle</m>,
              what is the probability that a measurement of the <m>z</m>-component of spin results in <m>S_z = +\hbar/2</m>?
              To determine this, turn on
              <q>Auto Fire</q>
              and keep it running until the percentages are not longer changing.

              what is the probability that a measurement of the <m>x</m>-component of spin results in <m>S_x = +\hbar/2</m>?
              To measure the <m>x</m>-component of spin, change the

              Now, change the number of magnets to 2.
              Orient the first magnet so that it is measuring the z-component of spin (angle<nbsp/>=<nbsp/>0) and orient the second magnet so that it is measuring the x-component of spin
              (<m>\mbox{angle} = -90^\circ</m>).
              In this setup the simulation starts with atoms in the state
              <m>\vert +x \rangle</m> and measures the <m>z</m>-component of spin.
              For atoms with measured <m>S_z = +\hbar/2</m>,
              it then measures the <m>x</m>-component of spin.
              For an atom that started in the state <m>\vert +x \rangle</m>,
              for which we then measure <m>S_z = +\hbar/2</m>,
              what is the probability that a subsequent measurement of the <m>x</m>-component of spin results in <m>S_x = +\hbar/2</m>?

              Based on your answer to part (c),
              what is the state of the atom immediately after a measurement of its <m>z</m>-component of spin results in <m>S_z = +\hbar/2</m>?

        A beam of electrons, prepared in a certain state <m>\ket{\psi}</m>,
