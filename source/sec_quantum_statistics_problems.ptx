      <p>
        In filling up the energy states of an infinite square well potential while obeying the Pauli exclusion principle,
        it is often stated that one electron can go in spin up and the other electron can go in spin down.
        This statement is reasonably correct,
        but it becomes incorrect if you interpret it to mean that the two electrons are in the state <m>|E_1\hspace{-1mm}\uparrow \hspace{2mm} E_1\hspace{-1mm}\downarrow\rangle</m>

        <em>Superconducting magnets.</em>
        One of the most productive uses of superconductors is in the fabrication of strong electromagnets (e.g., for magnetic resonance imaging in hospitals,
        or in massive particle accelerators).
        Consider a superconducting magnet constructed from a solenoid of 1000 turns of superconducting wire with radius
        <m>50\, \mbox{cm}</m> and length <m>1\, \mbox{m}</m>.
        A current <m>I</m> is applied,
        resulting in a magnetic field of 10<nbsp/>Tesla.
        Once the magnetic field is produced,
        what power would have to be provided to the electromagnet to maintain the magnetic field?

        What would happen if dice were indistinguishable bosons?
        Of course, real dice are too large for quantum effects to be significant,
        so they are classical, distinguishable objects.
        As a result,
        rolling a pair of classical dice yields 36 possible results (1-1, 1-2, 1-3, <ellipsis/>, 6-5, 6-6).
        <ol>

              If dice were indistinguishable bosons,
              then rolling a 2-5 combination would be exactly the same as rolling a 5-2 combination.
