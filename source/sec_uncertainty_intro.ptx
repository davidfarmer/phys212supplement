  <title>Introduction</title>
  <p>
    We concluded the last chapter with de<nbsp/>Broglie's hypothesis that all matter exhibits wave-particle duality,
    not just light.
    De Broglie's proposal is radical.
    Arguing that all matter has wave-like properties turns out to have far-reaching implications whose answers fundamentally change the way we view the laws of the universe.
    One important question is the following:
    waves are spread out over regions of space;
    so, <em>where is the particle</em>
    if it is acting like a wave?
  </p>
  <p>
    In this chapter,
    we will discuss the interpretation of de<nbsp/>Broglie's waves in terms of <em>probability</em>.
    An implication of this probabilistic description of matter waves is the well-known
    <em>Heisenberg uncertainty principle</em>,
    which states that a particle cannot simultaneously have a precise position and momentum.
    We will show that the uncertainty principle ends up solving one of the failures of classical physics:
    it explains why atoms are stable.
    The uncertainty principle also limits our ability to measure and manipulate matter at small,
    sub-atomic scales.

    We finish the chapter with a generalization of de<nbsp/>Broglie's relation <mdash/> Schr&#xf6;dinger's equation <mdash/> that can be used to <em>calculate</em>
    wavefunctions for particles.
