  <title>Relation between Statistics and Spin</title>
  <p>
    All fundamental particles are either fermions or bosons.
    Strangely enough,
    which category they fall into is directly determined by their value of spin.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          All particles with spin <m>s=0</m>, <m>1</m>,
          <m>2</m>, <ellipsis/> or integer spin, are bosons:
          their two-particle states must be symmetric.
          This includes the photon and some more exotic particles that we will encounter in Unit 4.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          All particles with spin <m>s=1/2</m>, <m>3/2</m>,
          etc, which we call half-integer spin, are fermions:
          their two-particle states must be antisymmetric.
          These include electrons, protons,
          neutrons, and quarks, and more.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    The connection between the spin of a particle and its symmetry under exchange (swap) does not have a simple origin,
    and we will not try to explain it here.
    But it is another rule strictly obeyed by every particle.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that in some cases a collection of particles can act as a single particle.
    For example, a proton is really made up of three quarks.
    Each quark is a fermion,
    so if we imagine exchanging a pair of protons,
    we are really exchanging three pairs of quarks.
    Each quark exchange brings in a minus sign,
    so the net effect of exchanging the protons in a two-proton state is a factor of <m>(-1)^3=-1</m>.
    Thus, the proton will act like a fermion,
    as long as it makes sense to think of the proton as a unit, that is,
    as long as we are not considering some process that rips apart the protons.
  </p>
  <p>
    A similar game can be played with entire atoms.
    A helium-4 atom consists of two protons and two neutrons in the nucleus,
    orbited by two electrons.
    That is an even number of fermions,
    so if we make a two-atom state out of two helium atoms,
    they will be symmetric under exchange of the atoms.
    So the helium-4 atom, if it stays intact, acts as a boson.
