        <em>Probabilities with dice.</em>
        This problem gets at the idea of a probability distribution.
        Take two of your dice, roll them,
        and record the sum of the spots showing on the top faces. (This should be a number between 2 and 12!) Repeat until you have recorded 20 results.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Collect your results in three
              <q>bins.</q>
              How many trials do you find in the bin containing numbers 2, 3, 4, or 5?
              How many in the 6, 7, or 8 bin?
              In the 9, 10, 11, or 12 bin?
              Try to explain any patterns.
            </p>
          </li>

            <p>
              In problem session,
              combine your results with others to estimate the probabilities of getting a roll in each of the three bins.

        <em>Classical probabilities for finding your car.</em> John,
        an aspiring physics student, works part-time parking cars at a downtown hotel.
        The lot is a long, underground tunnel,
        with all the cars parked in a single long row,
        <m>600\Xunits{m}</m> long.
        When owners return for their cars,
        instead of telling them exactly where to find their cars,
        he describes the location in terms of probability and probability density.

        Back in 1975, Gordon Moore proposed that the number of transistors per area on integrated circuits roughly doubles every two years.
        This principle (
        <q>Moore's Law</q>
        ) has worked surprisingly well for 40 years now,
        with transistors introduced in 2012 as small as
        <m>22\Xunits{nm}</m> and techniques are continually being developed to make them even smaller.
        But Moore's Law will eventually fail due to limitations imposed by the uncertainty principle.

          <li>
            <p>
              Use the uncertainty principle to calculate the smallest spread
              <m>\sigma_x</m> for an electron such that its minimum kinetic energy
              (due to uncertainty)
              is below the work function
              (binding energy)
              of silicon, which is <m>4.05\Xunits{eV}</m>.

              Let's assume that the smallest possible transistor has an area 100 times the square of the
              <m>\sigma_x</m> that you calculated in part (a).
              Given the area
              (approximated as the square of <m>22\Xunits{nm}</m>)
              for the best transistors from 2012,
              if Moore's Law continues to hold into the future,
              roughly what year will transistors reach this quantum limit?

        and assume that the total energy of the particle <m>E</m> is <em>less</em>
        than the potential energy, i.e., <m>E\lt U_0</m>.
        (This isn't possible for classical motion, but continue anyway.)
        To determine the wave function we must find a function <m>\psi(x)</m> that satisfies the one-dimensional Schr&#xf6;dinger equation
        <me>
          -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{d^2\psi(x)}{dx^2} + U(x)\psi(x) = E\psi(x)
        </me>.
