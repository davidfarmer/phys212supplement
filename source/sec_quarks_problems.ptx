    <statement>
      <p>
        Think about what you are doing
        (or not doing)
        right at this minute. (a) Identify
        (and write down)
        as many forces as you can that are acting on you right now and/or are affecting your environment. (b) Describe what your life would be like if there were no forces or interactions at all.

  <exercise xml:id="prob_fifth_force">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Several years ago,
        a group of physicists claimed to have discovered a fifth force with a range of approximately <m>100\Xunits{m}</m>.
        If this force had turned out to be valid
        (few people believe this to be the case),
        what would have been the approximate
        (order of magnitude)
        mass of its messenger particle?
        Express your answer in eV/<m>c^2</m>.

  <exercise xml:id="prob_pair_annihilation_diagram">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Draw a Feynman diagram corresponding to the annihilation of an electron-positron pair.
        An electron moves to the right and hits a positron moving to the left.
        They annihilate each other,
        resulting in the formation of two photons,
        one moving left and the other moving right.
        <em>Hint:</em> You will need two vertices.

  <exercise xml:id="prob_gumby">
    <statement>
      <p>
        A Feynman diagram can be played with like a Gumby doll.
        You can bend all the branches up and down,
        as long as you follow one simple rule:
        every time you bend an upward-going branch downward
        (or a downward-going branch upward),
        you replace the particle with its antiparticle.
        For example, in <xref ref="fig_muon_W">Figure</xref>,
        if the <m>\nu_\mu</m> branch is bent downward,
        you can get the interaction <m>\overline\nu_\mu + \mu^- \to \overline\nu_e + e^-</m>.

        For each vertex diagram below,
        identify the missing particles, colors,
        or flavors denoted by a question mark.
        In other words, wherever you see a <sq>?</sq>,
        replace it with a type of particle,
        a color, or a type of quark.
