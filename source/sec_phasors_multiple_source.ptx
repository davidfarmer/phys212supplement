  <title>Phasor Diagrams for Multiple Source Interference</title>
  <p>
    Sometimes, more than two waves will interfere at a single point.
    In these cases,
    the total amplitude of the combined oscillation will be the superposition of all of the incident waves.
    The phasor addition technique can be used to calculate the total amplitude in these complicated cases.
    Consider, for example, three oscillations,
    all with the same angular frequency <m>\omega</m>,
    but with different amplitudes and phases:
    <md>
      <mrow>y_1(t) =\mathstrut \amp  A_1\cos{(\omega t + \phi_1)},</mrow>
      <mrow>y_2(t) =\mathstrut \amp  A_2\cos{(\omega t + \phi_2)}, \ { and}</mrow>
      <mrow>y_3(t) =\mathstrut \amp  A_3\cos{(\omega t + \phi_3)}</mrow>
    </md>.
  </p>
  <p>
    These three oscillations can be expressed graphically,
    as shown in <xref ref="fig_phasor15">Figure</xref>,
    and their superposition, <m>y_{ tot} = y_1 + y_2 + y_3</m>,
    can be determined from vector addition of the three phasors.

    One of the most common multi-source interference problems is an extension of the two-slit problem considered in class.
    Imagine a light source passing through a screen containing not two but <em>three</em> slits,
    each separated from its neighbor by a distance <m>d</m>,
    as shown in <xref ref="fig_phasor16">Figure</xref>.
    The interference pattern for this arrangement of slits will look different from the interference pattern for a two-slit setup.
  </p>
  <figure xml:id="fig_phasor16">
    <caption>Three closely spaced slits, illuminated straight-on
    from the right. The interference pattern is observed on a distant screen to the right.</caption>
    <image width="92.5%" source="images/phasor16"/>
  </figure>
  <figure xml:id="fig_phasor17">
    <caption>Light rays exiting the three slits
    parallel to the normal.</caption>
    <image width="92.5%" source="images/phasor17"/>
  </figure>
  <p>
    If the interference pattern illuminates a screen a distance <m>L</m> from the slits,
    where <m>L\gg d</m>,
    then we can assume that the light rays from each of the slits to any particular point on the screen are parallel.
    (This is the same approximation we made in the two-slit case.)
    For example,
    light passing straight through the slits and continuing straight to the screen produce the central maximum in the interference pattern,
    as in <xref ref="fig_phasor17">Figure</xref>.
    These rays combine constructively because there's no difference in the path length for the three light rays,
    i.e., <m>\Delta r = 0</m> for all three rays.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now consider the light rays traveling at an angle <m>\theta</m> to the normal,
    as in <xref ref="fig_phasor18">Figure</xref>.
    Just as in the two-slit case,
    these rays do not travel the same distance to reach the screen.
    Light from the bottom slit travels the shortest distance,
    while light from the middle slit travels an extra distance <m>\Delta r_{21}</m>,
    and light from the top slit travels the same amount of extra distance (<m>\Delta r_{32} = \Delta r_{21}</m>) compared to light from the middle slit (Here, I've implicitly labeled the slits, #1, 2, and 3 for bottom, middle,
    and top.).
  </p>
  <figure xml:id="fig_phasor18">
    <caption>Light rays exiting at an angle <m>\theta</m> to
    the normal.</caption>
    <image width="92.5%" source="images/phasor18"/>
  </figure>
  <figure xml:id="fig_phasor19">
    <caption>Geometry of path-length difference
    between rays from three slits. As for the double slit, the path length
    difference for adjacent slits is <m>d\sin\theta</m> if the rays are nearly parallel.</caption>
    <image width="92.5%" source="images/phasor19"/>
  </figure>
  <p>
    From the geometry of the problem
    (shown in <xref ref="fig_phasor19">Figure</xref>),
    it's clear that <m>\Delta r_{32} = \Delta r_{21} = d\sin{\theta}</m>.
    We can then calculate the phase difference between light from adjacent slits,
    <men>
      \Delta \phi = 2\pi \frac{\Delta r}{\lambda} = 2\pi \frac{d\sin{\theta}}{\lambda}
    </men>.
  </p>
  <p>
    With knowledge of the phase difference,
    we can draw a phasor diagram and plot phasors for all three light rays,
    as shown in <xref ref="fig_phasor20">Figure</xref>.
    We've assumed that the amplitudes of all three phasors is the same,
    and connected the phasors head-to-tail instead of placing all three with tails at the origin.
    Note that <m>\Delta\phi</m> is the phase difference between
    <em>adjacent</em> phasors.
    The total amplitude of the combined rays is just the vector sum of the phasors:

    <statement>
      <p>
        Light of wavelength <m>\lambda = 478\Xunits{nm}</m> passes through a three-slit system where the slits are separated by a distance <m>d = 1.5 \times 10^{-6}\Xunits{m}</m>,
        and produces an interference pattern on a distant screen.
        What is the amplitude of the light directed at an angle
        <m>\theta = 1.2^\circ</m> from the direction to the central maximum in the interference pattern?
        Assume that the amplitude of the light from each slit individually is <m>A</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        This is a direct application of the method described above.
        The phase difference between adjacent slits is
        <md>
          <mrow>\Delta \phi =\mathstrut \amp  2\pi \frac{\Delta r}{\lambda}</mrow>

        Therefore, our phasor diagram looks like <xref ref="fig_phasor22">Figure</xref>.
        To calculate the total amplitude,
        we again add the phasors as vectors:

        So the amplitude of the resultant phasor is
        <men>
          A_{ tot} = \sqrt{(2.6A)^2 + (1.13A)^2} = 2.83A

    <statement>
      <p>
        For the same setup as in the previous example,
        at what angle <m>\theta</m> would you expect to find the first minimum?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        A minimum in the interference pattern will occur when the amplitude of the resultant phasor is zero,
        so we need to arrange the three phasors such that they add to zero.
        When we had only two phasors,
        this was quite easy <mdash/> we chose <m>\Delta \phi = \pi</m>.
        In this case, however, we need to make
        <em>three</em> phasors add to zero,
        and <m>\Delta \phi = \pi</m> won't work (what would a phasor diagram with three phasors,
        each differing in phase from its neighbor by <m>\Delta \phi = \pi</m> look like?)
      </p>
      <figure xml:id="fig_phasor23">
        <caption>Phasor diagram at the first minimum of the three-slit
        interference pattern.</caption>
        <image width="92.5%" source="images/phasor23"/>
      </figure>
      <p>
        To get three phasors to add to zero,
        we need a diagram like <xref ref="fig_phasor23">Figure</xref>,
        where the phase difference between adjacent phasors is <m>\Delta\phi = \frac{2\pi}{3}\Xunits{rad}</m>.
        Make sure you understand why this arrangement yields a total amplitude of zero.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that we know the required value for <m>\Delta\phi</m>,
        we can relate this to the path length difference between adjacent slits:
        <men>
          \Delta r = \frac{\Delta\phi}{2\pi} \lambda
        </men>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since <m>\Delta r = d\sin{\theta}</m>,
        we can solve for <m>\sin{\theta}</m>:
        <md>
          <mrow>\sin{\theta} =\mathstrut \amp  \frac{\Delta r}{d}</mrow>
          <mrow>=\mathstrut \amp  \frac{\Delta\phi\lambda}{2\pi d}</mrow>
          <mrow>=\mathstrut \amp  \frac{2\pi(478 \times 10^{-9})}{6 \pi (1.5 \times 10^{-6})}</mrow>
          <mrow>=\mathstrut \amp  0.106</mrow>
        </md>
        and therefore <m>\theta = \sin^{-1}{(0.106)} = 6.1^\circ</m>.
      </p>

        <image width="92.5%" source="images/phasor24"/>
      </figure>
      <p>
        There's actually another way to make three phasors add to zero,
        and the phasor diagram looks like <xref ref="fig_phasor24">Figure</xref>: In this case,
        <m>\Delta\phi = \frac{4\pi}{3}</m>,
        and you can show that this minimum will occur for <m>\theta = 12.3^\circ</m>.
