    <statement>
      <p>
        Use the time in <xref ref="table_early_universe">Table</xref>

  <exercise xml:id="prob_Lambda_pair_production">
    <statement>
      <p>
        About how long after the Big Bang would there be insufficient energy to create <m>\Lambda</m>-<m>\overline\Lambda</m> pairs?

  <exercise xml:id="prob_baryon_abundance">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Assuming that one photon is released in each baryon-antibaryon annihilation,
        why are there <m>10^9</m> photons/baryon after annihilation and not some other number?

      <p>
        What is the thermal energy per particle available at <m>t = 1\Xunits{s}</m>?
        How does this compare with the combined rest energies of an electron-positron pair?
        What happens to positrons after this time?

        List the types of particles you might expect to find abundantly in the early universe during the following epochs:

  <exercise xml:id="prob_background_radiation">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Use <xref ref="eq_early_univ_temp"/> to estimate the photon temperature at the present time
        (<m>\sim</m>10<ndash/>15 billion years after the Bang).
        Note that this is an overestimate since the assumptions of <xref ref="eq_early_univ_temp"/> have broken down.

  <exercise xml:id="prob_transparent_universe">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Transition energies for typical atomic states are about 1<ndash/><m>10\Xunits{eV}</m>.
        That is, photons in this energy range are captured by atoms to excite upward transitions.
        Use <xref ref="eq_early_univ_energy"/> to estimate when in the early universe this
        <q>capture effect</q>
        became energetically impossible.

  <exercise xml:id="prob_X_asymmetry">
    <statement>
      <p>
        The <m>X</m> and <m>\overline X</m> bosons decay slightly differently because of a small flaw in charge conjugation invariance.
        Suppose the decay scheme for <m>X</m> had the following branching ratios:
        <image width="92.5%" source="images/X_decay"/> That is,
        there is a 90% probability that <m>X</m> decays to two quarks,
        and a 10% chance that <m>X</m> decays to an antiquark plus an antilepton.
        Similarly suppose <m>\overline X</m> decays by <image width="92.5%" source="images/antiX_decay"/>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Take 3000 random <m>X</m>'s and 3000 random <m>\overline X</m>'s.
              How many each of quarks, leptons, antiquarks,
              and antileptons would appear after all <m>X</m>'s and <m>\overline X</m>'s decayed?
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Let all the quarks combine into baryons,
              and all the antiquarks combine into antibaryons.
              How many of each are there?

          <li>
            <p>
              Now let all the particles and antiparticles annihilate as completely as possible.
              What's left over?
              Assume one photon is released from each annihilation.
