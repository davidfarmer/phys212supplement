  <title>Absorption, Emission, and Spectroscopy</title>
  <p>
    Okay, we are now ready to address some questions that you might have asked when you were a kid:
    <q>Why is a tomato red?</q>
    or
    <q>How do glow-in-the-dark shirts work?</q>
    or
    <q>Why is it that black-light illumination
    (which looks kinda deep violet in color)
    cause certain pigments to glow orange</q>
    or
    <q>Why do certain laundry detergents make my clothes look so unnaturally bright white?</q>
    These questions all fall under the category of the topic of photophysics or photochemistry,
    i.e., the physics and chemistry of how light interacts with matter.
    In addition to providing answers to these questions,
    this subject also relates to the important topic of <em>spectroscopy</em>
    which is a critical diagnostic technique that spans all fields of science and engineering.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are a few different ways in which light
    (and any electromagnetic radiation)
    can interact with matter,
    but two important processes are absorption and emission of individual photons of light.
    <xref ref="fig_absorption_emission">Figure</xref> shows these two processes.
    If a photon strikes a material,
    it can be absorbed by an electron,
    resulting in an increase in the energy of that electron from an initial (lower) value <m>E_1</m> to a higher value <m>E_2</m>,
    as shown in <xref ref="fig_absorption_emission">Figure</xref>a.
    This process must conserve energy,
    which means that the energy gained by the electron must be the same as the energy of the absorbed photon:
    <men xml:id="eq_photon_energy">
      E_\text{ ph }  = \Delta E = |E_\text{ final }  - E_\text{ initial } |
    </men>
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that the upper energy level state must initially be unoccupied for this process to work.
    As we'll see in <xref ref="chap_quantum_statistics">Chapter</xref>,
    two electrons cannot occupy the same quantum state.
  </p>
  <p>
    The process of emission is the same thing in reverse
    (<xref ref="fig_absorption_emission">Figure</xref>b).
    An electron in a higher energy state can drop to a lower-energy state
    (if initially unoccupied),
    releasing a single photon with an energy given by <xref ref="eq_photon_energy"/>.
  </p>
  <p>
    These simple quantum principles now enable us to resolve the third of the great failures of classical physics <mdash/> the observation in the early 1900s that when energy is pumped into atoms,
    they radiate EM waves only at certain distinct wavelengths;
    i.e., the problem of discrete atomic spectral lines discussed in <xref ref="chap_beyond_classical">Chapter</xref>.
    The explanation is actually quite simple:
    each element or molecule has its own discrete,
    quantized energy level structure (e.g., <xref ref="fig_energy_levels">Figure</xref>).
    An electron in an atom can make transitions between the energy levels.
    Any transition from a higher to a lower energy level will result in the emission of a photon.
    But since there are only certain,
    well-defined, quantized energy levels for the electron,
    then there are only certain well-defined <em>differences</em>
    <m>\Delta E</m> allowed for the transitions between these levels.
    And since the photons emitted by these transitions have energy <m>E_\text{ ph }  = |\Delta E|</m>,
    that means that the emitted photons have only certain,
    well-defined energies.
    And since the energy of the photon is related to the frequency and wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation via <m>E_\text{ ph }  = hf = hc/\lambda</m>,
    that means that the light emitted by atoms has only certain,
    well-defined, discrete wavelengths.

    <title>Light emitted from a molecule with four energy levels</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        For a molecule with the four-level system in <xref ref="fig_energy_levels">Figure</xref>,
        assume that <m>E_0 = -11.5\Xunits{eV}</m>,
        <m>E_1=-6.2\Xunits{eV}</m>, <m>E_2 = -5.4\Xunits{eV}</m>,
        and <m>E_3 = -2.5\Xunits{eV}</m>. (a) Determine how many different wavelengths of EM radiation can be emitted from this molecule,
        and calculate (b) the largest and (c) the smallest wavelengths of EM radiation that can be emitted from this molecule.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        (a) There are several possible transitions that an electron can make that will emit a photon in this system.
        An electron can drop from energy level 3 down to level 0, 1 or 2;
        it can drop from energy level 2 down to level 0 or 1;
        and it can drop from energy level 1 down to level 0.
        Altogether, there are 6 possible downward energy transitions,
        so there are 6 possible wavelengths of light that can be emitted.
      </p>
      <figure xml:id="fig_energy_levels2">

      </figure>
      <p>
        For parts (b) and (c), for any emitted photon,
        the energy <m>E_text{ph} = |\Delta E|</m> and since <m>E_\text{ ph }  = hc/\lambda</m>,
        it follows that <m>hc/\lambda = |\Delta E|</m> and <m>\lambda = hc/\Delta E</m>.
        So, the largest and smallest wavelengths correspond to the smallest and largest energy differences
        <m>\Delta E</m>. (b) The smallest energy difference
        <m>\Delta E</m> given the allowed electron energies is the energy difference between levels 2 and 1.
        So, the largest emitted wavelength is:
        <men>
          \lambda = \frac{hc}{\Delta E} = \frac{1240 \Xunits{eV \cdot nm}}{|-5.4 \Xunits{eV} - (-6.2 \Xunits{eV})|} = \frac{1240 \Xunits{eV \cdot nm}}{0.8 \Xunits{eV}} = 1550 \Xunits{nm}
        </men>,
        where we have used the result <m>hc = 1240\Xunits{eV \cdot nm}</m>,
        which is convenient for spectra problems where the energy levels and differences are expressed in electron volts and the wavelengths of emitted and absorbed light are expressed in nanometers.
        We could have converted everything into SI units and used typical values for <m>h</m> and <m>c</m>,
        but that is more time-consuming.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that the longest wavelength emitted is a value beyond the visible spectrum
        (this is in the infrared spectrum),
        so the human eye wouldn't be able to see this emitted light. (c) For the shortest wavelength for emitted EM radiation,
        we want the largest <m>\Delta E</m> possible for these four energy levels,
        which corresponds to a transition from energy level 3 down to energy level 0.
        <men>
          \lambda = \frac{hc}{\Delta E} = \frac{1240 \Xunits{eV \cdot nm}}{|-2.5 \Xunits{eV} - (-11.5 \Xunits{eV})|} = \frac{1240 \Xunits{eV \cdot nm}}{9.0 \Xunits{eV}} = 138 \Xunits{nm}
        </men>
      </p>
      <p>
        This wavelength is also outside the visible spectrum
        (it's ultraviolet, in this case).
      </p>
    </solution>
  </example>
  <p>
    Everything in the previous example works the other way for absorption.
    But instead of an electron dropping to a lower energy level and emitting a photon,
    a photon is absorbed and the electron jumps up to a higher energy level.
    But this only works if the incoming photon has the right energy.
    From a practical perspective,
    if you shine white light through a gas of a particle element or molecule,
    all the light will pass through <em>except</em>
    for light with particular wavelengths and energies corresponding to the energy differences <m>\Delta E</m> for the sample.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since each element and each molecule has its own distinctive energy-level structure,
    the spectrum of EM radiation emitted is unique to each,
    as is the spectrum of radiation absorbed.
    This
    <q>fingerprint</q>
    is often used to identify materials in systems as diverse as a microscopic sample of DNA<fn>
    Spectroscopy is often used in the biological sciences.
    We have had many biology majors in PHYS 212 in the past who have commented that they see these techniques used quite often in the biology labs at Bucknell.
    </fn> up to astronomical-scale objects such as stars and planets;
    large, nebular clouds that are collapsing to form new stars and planetary systems;
    and accretion disks of gas spiraling into supermassive black holes at the centers of
    <q>active</q>
    galaxies.<fn>
    Spectroscopy is the most important tool for identifying materials in distant astronomical objects.
    It's not as though we can go collect a sample of gas from a nebula 100,000 light years away.
    The light that we see from these objects is the only data that we have in most cases.
    </fn>

  <p>
    So, why is a tomato red?
    Answer: because it contains a pigment called lycopene that has electronic energy levels with an energy difference corresponding to the energy of red photons.
    When an electron in an excited state in lycopene drops to a lower level,
    it emits red photons.
    (Lycopene is actually a fluorescent pigment;
    fluorescence is discussed in the next section.)
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, absorption and emission also work for solids with band structures similar to that in <xref ref="fig_bands">Figure</xref>.
    There are many, closely-spaced energy levels within the bands,
    allowing for EM radiation with very large wavelengths to be emitted and absorbed.
    But it is also possible for electrons to make transitions between the bands,
    resulting in larger energy differences and smaller wavelengths for emitted or absorbed light.
  </p>
  <example xml:id="exam_absorption_bands">
    <title>Absorption by a material with a band gap</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A light detector uses a material with a filled valence band
        (all available energy states occupied by an electron)
        and an empty conduction band separated by a band gap energy of <m>3.2\Xunits{eV}</m>.
        Calculate the largest wavelength of light most effectively absorbed by this detector.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        The energy of the photon <m>E_\text{ ph } = |\Delta E|</m> and since <m>E_\text{ ph } = hc/\lambda</m>,
        it follows that <m>hc/\lambda = |\Delta E|</m>.
        The largest wavelength corresponds to the smallest energy difference <m>\Delta E</m>.
        Since the valence band is filled,
        the nearest unoccupied energy level is at the bottom of the conduction band,
        so <m>\Delta E_\text{ min } = 3.2\Xunits{eV}</m>.
        So <m>\lambda_\text{ max } = hc/\Delta E = (1240\Xunits{eV \cdot nm})/(3.2 \Xunits{eV}) = 387.5\Xunits{nm}</m>.
