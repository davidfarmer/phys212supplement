  <title>Introduction</title>
  <p>
    We have seen that particles have wave-like properties,
    and that the de<nbsp/>Broglie relation,
    connecting the properties of momentum and wavelength,
    has far-reaching consequences for the behavior of atoms and other microscopic systems.
    The main consequence is that the idea of a particle as a point-like object having a precise position at any given time has to be replaced with a probability density describing a distribution of positions where the particle is likely to be found.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the previous chapter,
    we introduced the idea of a wavefunction <m>\psi(x)</m> from which we can determine the probability density <m>P(x) = |\psi(x)|^2</m>.
    We also discussed Heisenberg's uncertainty principle,
    that states that there is a minimum combined spread in a particles position and momentum,
    a principle that also leads to a minimum kinetic energy for any confined particle.
    And at the end of the previous chapter,
    we introduced the Schr&#xf6;dinger equation which enables us to determine wavefunctions for particles in regions of given potential energy.

  <p>
    In this chapter,
    we show how Schr&#xf6;dinger's Equation predicts the <em>quantization</em>
    of energies for confined particles,
    i.e., only certain, well-defined energies are allowed.<fn>
    This is where the
    <q>quantum</q>
    in the name
    <q>quantum mechanics</q>
    comes from.
    </fn> Quantization of energies is a profound and distinctly quantum principle (i.e., not predicted at all from classical mechanics) which has extensive applications in modern technology.
    We will illustrate quantization of particle energies with a simple system <mdash/> the
    <em>particle in a box</em>
    (also known as the <em>infinite square well potential</em>)
    <mdash/> for which solutions of Schr&#xf6;dinger's Equation are readily obtained.
    We will discuss the properties of this system,
    which has recently led to the development of <em>quantum dots</em>
    for use in numerous applications.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will also discuss how quantum systems absorb and emit light,
    a result that explains not only the colors that we see from many physical systems but which has also become a common tool for identifying the material constituents of a range of systems,
    from biological systems in microscopic studies up to stars and star-forming regions millions
    (and billions)
    of light years from the Earth.
