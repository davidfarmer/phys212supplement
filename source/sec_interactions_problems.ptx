  <exercise xml:id="prob_proton_decay">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose the proton's mean lifetime is <m>10^{31}</m> years.
        Now consider a pool of water <m>10\Xunits{m} \times 10\Xunits{m} \times 3\Xunits{m}</m>.
        Estimate the number of protons in the pool and then the number that you would expect to decay in one year.
        For this calculation,
        consider only the protons not bound in a complex nucleus;
        that is, only the protons in hydrogen atoms.

        Refer to <xref ref="table_mass_lifetimes">Table</xref> to answer the following:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Why must strangeness (<m>S</m>) change when <m>\Omega^-</m> decays?

  <exercise xml:id="prob_X_boson">
    <statement>
      <p>
        In <xref ref="sec_gut_theories">Section</xref>
        we discussed the possibility of proton decay.
        <xref ref="fig_proton_decay">Figure</xref> shows a <em>hypothetical</em>
        process in which proton decay is mediated by a
        <em>proposed</em> <m>X^{4/3}</m> boson,
        which carries a <m>+\textstyle{\frac{4}{3}}</m> charge.
        (The <m>X^{4/3}</m> boson has not been observed,
        and is not one of the particles included in the tables in this supplement.)
        Note that the general rule for interactions involving an <m>X</m>-boson would be:
        <me>
          \mbox{quark}  +\mbox{quark}  \to X \to \mbox{antiquark}  + \mbox{antilepton}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Another possible proton decay scheme,
        using a <m>X^{1/3}</m> boson
        (with <m>+\textstyle{\frac{1}{3}}</m> charge),
        would be <m>p \to \pi^+ + \overline\nu_e</m>.
        Construct a reaction diagram like <xref ref="fig_proton_decay">Figure</xref>
        showing this hypothesized decay process.
        Be sure to conserve charges at each vertex!

    <statement>
      <p>
        In <xref ref="fig_neutron_decay">Figure</xref>,
        label the colors of any particle in the diagram that has a color.
        Be sure to satisfy the <em>colorless rule</em> for any hadron,
        and don't label colors on any particle that does
        <em>not</em> carry color.
        (Note: there are several right answers to this question.)

    <statement>
      <p>
        For each of the following reaction diagrams,
        identify the messenger particle and state the type of interaction involved
        (strong, weak, electromagnetic, or gravitational).
        Denote the colors and/or charges for each messenger, where appropriate.
