        Let's verify the details for the quantum mechanics prediction for the Bell experiment with the positron detector rotated
        <m>45^\circ</m> from the <m>+z</m> direction.
        We'll use a simulation of the Stern-Gerlach Experiment.

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              In the simulation rotate the angle to <m>45^\circ</m>,
              and change the spin orientation to
              <q><m>+z</m></q>. You now have the simulation set up to take atoms with <m>S_z</m> =
              <m>+\hbar/2</m> and measure the spin of these particles along a <m>45^\circ</m> angle.

          <li>
            <p>
              To get a feel for how this works, try firing a few atoms.
              You'll notice a counter at the bottom of the page keeping track of how many atoms have been measured with spin up or spin down as measured along a <m>45^\circ</m> angle.

              and keep it running until the percentages are no longer changing.
              (Increase the speed of the auto fire so that you don't have to wait forever.)
              Based on the results of the simulation,
              what is the probability of measuring <m>S_{45^\circ}</m> = <m>+\hbar/2</m>?

              calculate the probability of measuring a particle to have
              <m>\ket{\nearrow}</m> if it started in the state <m>\ket{\uparrow}</m>.
              Do your results agree with those of the simulation?

        Einstein died in 1955, before Bell had derived his theorem and well before Aspect did the experiments that ruled out hidden variable theories.
        It is often stated that refusing to accept quantum mechanics is one of Einstein's mistakes.
        What do you think of that statement?

        Suppose we modified Bell's experiment and aligned the positron detector to be at a

              In quantum mechanics,
              if the electron is measured to be spin down (<m>S_z=-\hbar/2</m>),
              what is the probability that the positron will be found to have <m>S_{60^\circ} =+\hbar/2</m>?
              There are two ways to approach this.
              You can use Eqs.<nbsp/><xref ref="eq_rotated_basis"/> and <xref ref="eq_b_variables"/>.
              You can also use the same simulation as in Problem # <xref ref="prob_epr_sim"></xref>.
