        Let's apply what we have learned about infinite square wells to a macromolecule confined to a biological cell.
        Consider a protein of mass <m>250,000 \Xunits{u}</m>
        (where <m>1\Xunits{u} = 1.661 \times 10^{-27}\Xunits{kg}</m>)
        confined to a <m>10 \Xunits{ \mu m}</m>-diameter cell.
        Treating this as a particle in a one-dimensional square well,
        find the energy difference between the ground state and the first excited state.
        Given that biochemical reactions typically involve energies on the order of <m>1\Xunits{eV}</m>,
        what so you conclude about the role of quantization in these reactions?

      <p>
        In order for the wavefunction solution to be continuous and smooth across the boundary at <m>x = L</m>,
        the value of the wavefunction and its first derivative for the two solutions must match up at the boundary at <m>x = L</m>.

                k^2 = \frac{2 m E}{\hbar^2} \hspace{0.5in} \mbox{and}  \hspace{0.5in} \kappa^2 = \frac{2m \left( U_0 - E \right)}{\hbar^2}

        <em>Semi-infinite square-well potential.</em>
        Download the Excel worksheet <c>semi-finite.xls</c> from either the <em>Handouts</em>
        page or from the Calendar page.
        This sheet shows the calculations for determining the wavefunctions for a potential well that is infinite at <m>x=0</m> but of finite magnitude on the right side of the well
        (which is at <m>x=5</m> in this problem).
        You'll see two graphs: the top one shows the semi-infinite potential well
        (in purple)
        along with a non-normalized plot of the calculated wavefunction so you can see it along with the potential.
        The bottom graph shows the normalized wavefunction,
        corresponding to the second-to-last column in the worksheet.
      </p>

        When you bring up the worksheet,
        the energy will be set for the value for the ground state.

              (just the first page!)
              the wavefunctions that are displayed for the ground state along with at least two of the excited states.
              To display the 1<m>^{ st}</m> and <m>2^{ nd}</m> excited states,
              type in 0.64282 and 1.4144 respectively in the framed box for energy.

              one of the well-defined energies for the problem?
              Try it out, and comment on what happens.
              Had we not told you what the allowed energies were,

      <p>
        Use this data to verify the <m>1/R^2</m> dependence of <xref ref="eq_QDot"/> and to find the band gap energy.
        (Hint: Calculate <m>E_\text{ ph }</m> for each of these wavelengths,
        and then plot <m>E_\text{ ph }</m> versus <m>1/R^2</m>;
        a computer can make the calculations,
        plotting, and fitting easier.)
