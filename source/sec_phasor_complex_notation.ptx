  <title>Phasors as Complex Numbers</title>
  <p>
    You may have encountered complex numbers in your math classes.
    Recall that a complex number <m>z</m> can be written as
    <men>
      z = a + ib
    </men>
    with <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> real numbers,
    and that <m>i</m> is the imaginary unit, <m>i = \sqrt{-1}</m>.
    Here <m>a</m> is called the <em>real part</em>
    of <m>z</m> [written <m>\mbox{Re} (z)</m>], while <m>b</m> is called the <em>imaginary part</em>
    of <m>z</m> [written <m>\mbox{Im} (z)</m>].
  </p>
  <p>
    It's easy to represent a complex number graphically.
    Just plot the real part complex number along the horizontal,
    or real axis,
    and the imaginary part along the vertical, or imaginary axis,
    as shown in <xref ref="fig_complexPlane">Figure</xref>.
  </p>
  <figure xml:id="fig_complexPlane">
    <caption>A complex number can be represented
    graphically as a point in the complex plane.</caption>
    <image width="41%" source="images/complex_plane"/>
  </figure>
  <p>
    The length of the diagonal line from the origin to the point representing the complex number <m>z</m> is the
    <em>magnitude</em> of <m>z</m>,
    and corresponds the amplitude of the oscillation <m>A</m>,
    and the angle with respect to the positive real axis corresponds to the phase angle <m>\phi</m>,
    as shown in <xref ref="fig_complexPhasor">Figure</xref>,
    which is really just a phasor diagram!
  </p>
  <figure xml:id="fig_complexPhasor">
    <caption>Phasors correspond to complex numbers.</caption>
    <image width="41%" source="images/complex_phasor"/>
  </figure>
  <p>
    Applying simple trig to the diagram gives
    <men>
      a = \mbox{Re} (z) = A \cos\phi\hspace{0.5in}b = \mbox{Im} (z) = A\sin\phi
    </men>.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is the real part of the complex number that corresponds to the physical oscillation,
    but using the complex representation actually simplifies many calculations.
  </p>
  <p>
    The connection to phasors gets even stronger when we make use of the Euler identity
    <men xml:id="eq_euler">
      e^{i\phi} = \cos\phi + i\sin\phi
    </men>,
    so that
    <md>
      <mrow>z = a + ib =\mathstrut \amp  A\cos\phi + i A\sin\phi</mrow>
      <mrow>=\mathstrut \amp  A(\cos\phi + i\sin\phi)</mrow>
      <mrow>=\mathstrut \amp  Ae^{i\phi}</mrow>
    </md>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thus, if we have an oscillation represented in complex exponential form,
    we can immediately draw its phasor picture: Make an arrow of length <m>A</m> at angle <m>\phi</m> from the real (horizontal) axis.

    <title>Another Day at the Beach</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The change in water level at your location is now represented with the following complex function (whose real part is the actual water height):
        <men>
          y(t) = 25 \, e^{i(\pi/4\, t + \pi/2)}
        </men>,
        with <m>y</m> in cm and <m>t</m> in sec.
        Draw a phasor diagram to depict the level of the water at <m>t = 2</m>, 3 and <m>4\Xunits{s}</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        Draw the real and imaginary axes.
        Starting at the real axis, go counterclockwise for <m>\pi/2</m> radians
        (the phase constant <m>\phi_0</m>).
        Then keep going counterclockwise <m>\pi/4</m> radians for each second of elapsed time.
        The phasors are shown in <xref ref="fig_phasorRotation">Figure</xref>.
      </p>

        To find actual water levels, take the real part
        (the horizontal projection).
        The water levels are thus
