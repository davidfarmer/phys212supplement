        A one-dimensional periodic potential composed of 10 side-by-side finite square well potentials has a valence band with 10 energy levels from a low of <m>0.81\Xunits{ eV}</m> to a high of
        <m>1.10\Xunits{eV}</m> and a conduction band with 10 levels ranging from
        <m>3.19\Xunits{eV}</m> to <m>4.39\Xunits{eV}</m> . The Fermi energy
        (in the middle of the band gap)
        is <m>2.145\Xunits{eV}</m> for this system.
        Assume that there are 20 electrons in this system
        (this is analogous to 10 atoms with 2 valence electrons each).

              <q>FDForTenWells.xlsx</q>
              from the calendar page.
              This worksheet calculates Fermi-Dirac probabilities for electrons to occupy any of the 10 conduction band energies.
              The sheet also calculates an expected average number of electrons in each of these levels
              (by multiplying the probability by 2, since there are two energy levels per state)
              and adds up the total number of electrons expected in the conduction band.
              Use this worksheet to calculate the estimated number of conduction band electrons for <m>T = 300</m>, 3000, and <m>30000\Xunits{K}</m>.
              For each of these temperatures,
              would you expect this system to be an electrical insulator or electrical conductor?

              conduction band level to be filled for a material to be a reasonable conductor,

              A third wire is connected to the right pn junction.
              If a very small current is fed into the device through this third wire,
              there can be a significant conduction of electricity between the two end wires if the current is going to the left.
              Explain why.
