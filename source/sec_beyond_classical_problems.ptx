            Let's say that you want to probe the structure of a bacteriophage T4 virus.<fn>
            These viruses <mdash/> which attack common bacteria <mdash/> are amazingly cool.
            They are like little lunar landers that land on the surface of a bacterium,
            after which they inject DNA into the bacterium,
            which then produces many more of the viruses before exploding.
            See, e.g., Kanamuru et al., Nature
            <em>415</em>, p. 553 (2002).
            </fn> One way to probe the virus is to look at it with electromagnetic waves.
            If one wants to
            <q>see</q>
            the T4 structure with a resolution of about <m>1\Xunits{nm}</m>,

        A few years ago there was a flurry of attention given to the potential hazards of electromagnetic fields from overhead power lines.
        The concern is that the alternating current (AC) in these power lines was emitting radiation that could cause cancer.

              The AC current in power lines alternates with a frequency of <m>60\Xunits{Hz}</m>.
              Use this to determine the energy of photons emitted from the power lines

        As discussed in the reading, the Equipartition Theorem says that,
